The [time.sfz](./time.sfz) file is an example on how to synthesize the MIDI signals sent by `klickly` using your own sound samples.  
It is a configuration file in [sfz format](https://sfzformat.com/), which can be used in combination with a [sfz player](https://sfzformat.com/software/players/) such as [liquidsfz](https://github.com/swesterfeld/liquidsfz) to play your samples.  
To be able to use it, you'll at least have to adjust the `default_path` variable.
